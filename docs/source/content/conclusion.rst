Conclusion
==========

sangeranalyseR provides a new approach to do Sanger sequencing data analysis in R. The main features include well-structured S4 classes, automated data analysis, interactive Shiny apps, exporting reads to FASTA and the generation thorough report. We hope it will be helpful for R users and the bioinformatics community!


splam is a new deep-learning-based splice junction recognizer that helps us to better understand 

We propose a novel splice junction recognition model called SPLAM, which is a deep convolutional neural
network being able to train on laptop computers. Our approach incorporates several innovative training
concepts. Firstly, we leverage expression information from thousands of samples across different human
tissues in the GTEX project to enhance the quality of splice junctions. Furthermore, we propose a distinctive
method for selecting negative splice junction-like sequences, with a specific focus on those supported by
soley one single splice alignment situated on the opposite strand of the protein coding genes.
